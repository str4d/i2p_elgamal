# i2p_elgamal

Implementation of I2P's ElGamal public-key encryption scheme over the 2048-bit
MODP DH group.

This implementation is not constant-time (yet).

The original implementation in Java I2P was based on algorithms 8.17 and 8.18
specified in section 8.4.1 of the Handbook of Applied Cryptography.
